## How to use

Just select a symbol and hit `Ctrl + Cmd + Opt + T` or select Symbol Text Inspector from the plugin menu.  If it has text overrides, you'll see a summary of all the text specifications that sketch exposes. 

## Release Notes

In some cases, the font is not found on your computer in which case you'll see an error for that text override in the list.  

This plugin currently only inspects the first symbol in the selection, it will not display text overrides for multiple selected symbols.
